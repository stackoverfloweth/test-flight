# Test-Flight

## Objectives:
* Create a basic CRUD app that allows you to manage Accounts and Students through a simple Dashboard.
* Deploy the app using a free-tier Heroku instance.

## Constraints:
* An **Account** can have many **Students**.
* A **Student** belongs to a single **Account** 
* An **Account** can have many **Contacts**, but there can only be one primary **Contact**.
* **Contacts** should be globally unique.  E.G. A Contact cannot span multiple **Accounts**. 

## Notes:
* Don’t worry about making it look pretty. Keep it simple. 
* No specific attributes are required for a given table, just use whatever seems intuitive. 
* If you’re not 100% on a specific design decision, just pick whatever you feel is best and note any trade-offs made.
